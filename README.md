# Hawkers

Have you ever had a craving for your favourite hawker, checked online for their opening hours,
travelled all the way there in anticipation just to be greeted with a closed shutter?

Fear not because the Hawkers app is here to save you from the pain of wasted journeys and unfulfilled cravings!


Basic functionality:
Allows Hawker stalls to be listed on the app.
- Using a form, stalls can be listed including a picture, address, and most importantly, if they are open!!!!!
- Anybody else using the app can search their favourite hawker and have up to date information if the stall is open.
- Easy to see red for "closed", yellow for "closing soon" and green for "open"


3 types of user accounts:
- Hawker users so that a stall can only be listed by someone if they are a registered user.
- Consumers can sign up as users and add stalls of their choosing to a favourites list!
- Admin users to maintain order.


Secondary functions:
Having set favourites, users can opt to turn on different notifications.
- Be notified when a favourited Hawker changes it's status from open to closed
- Be notified when a favourited Hawker changes it's status from closed to open
- Hawkers can leave comments on their page, something like facebook, telling people why they are shut and when they look to reopen.

On a side note, I would like to make it so that the opening status follow the normal opening hours and is not completely reliant on 
the Hawker to update it. 
Now given that the opening status can change on it's own without the hawkers input, users should then only be notified if the opening status is changed by the hawker and not just when it's regular closing time.

If I've got extra time:
- Map integration to give users directions to their favourite stalls.
